# STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
In the Student Management system Project in python, we will see a project that manages all the information of the students It includes managing data such as name, email-id, contact number, date of birth, which stream they are in, etc.
In this tutorial of the Python project, we will build a GUI-based Student Management System Project using the Tkinter, SQLite3, tkcalendar, messagebox, and datetime and Ttk modules of the Tkinter library. It is an intermediate-level project, where you will learn how to use databases, and modules and make some great GUIs in Python and apply them in real life.
